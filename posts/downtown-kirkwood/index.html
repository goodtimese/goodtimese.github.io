As apartment landlords, you know that being secure and privacy-conscious is important in any building. But what about when someone is inside your building?
There are a few things that you can do to make sure your guests are safe and comfortable while they&rsquo;re in your building. One is to make sure all doors and windows are locked when they&rsquo;re not allowed in. Another is to install security cameras in your building, so you can see who&rsquo;s coming or going and make sure they&rsquo;re not causing damage.</p><p>Finally, be careful about who you let into your building. Make sure you have a list of people who have been approved by the police or other security forces before letting them into the building. This way, you can be sure that everyone who&rsquo;s entering is properly licensed and has proper identification.</p><h2 id=the-kirkwood---city-flats>The Kirkwood - City Flats<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-kirkwood---city-flats>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://homeiscityflats.com/files/2015/08/Kirkwood.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.uZpObiInuQ6OflYKcaXXowHaHZ&pid=15.1"' alt="The Kirkwood - City Flats"><p><em>Source: homeiscityflats.com</em></p><blockquote><p>kirkwood schedule tour.</p></blockquote><p>What are apartments and why do people live in them?
