They can be difficult to find parking, have high monthly payments, and often lack privacy.</p></li><li><p>Some people find apartments ideal for those who want a large space to spread out and who do not mind living close to others. However, others find the layout too cramped or noisy for their liking.</p></li><li><p>Although apartments may be cheaper than houses, they typically require more maintenance and cannot be used as their own home. This means that tenants must also pay for repairs and upkeep on the property as well as receive special deals from landlords in order to live in them.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://goodtimese.github.io/posts/northwest-portland-apartments/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Northwest Portland Apartments ~ Metro Housing Bond’s First Project, The Mary Ann Apartments In</span></a>
