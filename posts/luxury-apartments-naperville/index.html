Apartment living has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many people looking for a place to call home. However, there are a variety of different types of apartments available, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here are four key distinctions between apartments and other types of housing:</p><ol><li><p>Rentals: In most cases, apartments are rented to individuals rather than being bought outright. This means that the landlord usually pays the tenant directly – either monthly or annually – rather than providing finance or assistance in finding a lender. As a result, rentals tend to be cheaper per month than buying an apartment outright.</p></li><li><p>Size: Apartments vary in size from small to large. Most typically comprise two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms, while some can contain up to six bedrooms and bathrooms.</p></li></ol><h2 id=7028-s-clyde---chicago-il-apartments-for-rent>7028 S Clyde - Chicago, IL Apartments For Rent<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#7028-s-clyde---chicago-il-apartments-for-rent>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://res.cloudinary.com/apartmentlist/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,h_640,w_640/b4b178fad3a6c8a9c6f4c15a90ace76b.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.rUiblwrVr0SiBRgQABy8nQHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="7028 S Clyde - Chicago, IL apartments for rent"><p><em>Source: apartmentlist.com</em></p><blockquote><p>clyde chicago.</p></blockquote><p>What to look for when choosing an apartment
