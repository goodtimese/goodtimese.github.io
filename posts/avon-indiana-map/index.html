As apartment landlords, you know that being secure and privacy-conscious is important in any building. But what about when someone is inside your building?
There are a few things that you can do to make sure your guests are safe and comfortable while they&rsquo;re in your building. One is to make sure all doors and windows are locked when they&rsquo;re not allowed in. Another is to install security cameras in your building, so you can see who&rsquo;s coming or going and make sure they&rsquo;re not causing damage.</p><p>Finally, be careful about who you let into your building. Make sure you have a list of people who have been approved by the police or other security forces before letting them into the building. This way, you can be sure that everyone who&rsquo;s entering is properly licensed and has proper identification.</p><h2 id=522-fletcher-ave-indianapolis-in-46203-apartments---indianapolis-in>522 Fletcher Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46203 Apartments - Indianapolis, IN<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#522-fletcher-ave-indianapolis-in-46203-apartments---indianapolis-in>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/KBcPTHHX_887HE3GIrz-e0e7q4a7x4FipUULvwaahco/111/522-fletcher-ave-indianapolis-in-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.2D1UM-yOmKTMLTDlo_LlnAHaFb&pid=15.1"' alt="522 Fletcher Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46203 Apartments - Indianapolis, IN"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Size and layout of apartments: How many people can live in an apartment
The average apartment size in the United States is 3,000 square feet. This size is large enough for most people to live comfortably but not so large that it becomes overwhelming. Some apartment buildings offer larger sizes, while others are smaller.
