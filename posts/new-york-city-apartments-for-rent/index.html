If you&rsquo;re not comfortable living alone, then do your research and find an apartment with someone who can share expenses and help out when needed.</p><p>Another consideration is whether or not you&rsquo;ll have enough space. Some apartments come with kitchens and bathrooms on one side only, so be sure to ask about any extra amenities that might be included.</p><p>Finally, think about what kind of lifestyle you want to create in your new home. Are you looking for a traditional apartment with all the cabling and appliances required?
