There are three main types of apartments institutional: single family, multifamily, and condo. Each type has its own set of benefits and drawbacks.
Single family apartments are the most common type in the United States. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and they’re often used by large banks or corporate headquarters. They have low monthly payments, a small number of bedrooms, and a manageable size.</p><p>Multifamily apartments have more bedrooms than a single family apartment but they’re usually much larger. They can be rented out as individual units or as part of an apartment complex. Multifamily units come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from studios to castles. They can also be rented out as part of a syndicate or community.</p><p>Condo apartments are the newest type of apartment building on the scene.</p><h2 id=clock-tower-penthouse-in-brooklyn-stuns-with-timeless-views-of-nyc-skyline>Clock Tower Penthouse In Brooklyn Stuns With Timeless Views Of NYC Skyline<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#clock-tower-penthouse-in-brooklyn-stuns-with-timeless-views-of-nyc-skyline>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/brooklyn-penthouse-NYC-views.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.T2ZRn8SzFAu8bYq8l7EGHQHaFC&pid=15.1"' alt="Clock Tower Penthouse in Brooklyn Stuns With Timeless Views Of NYC Skyline"><p><em>Source: decoist.com</em></p><blockquote><p>brooklyn penthouse nyc views clock tower york apartment apartments skyline friends story interior luxury bedroom ny clocktower dumbo triplex overlooking.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a wonderful way to live, especially if you&rsquo;re on a budget.
