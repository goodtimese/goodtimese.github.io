Here are some of the most common security features that apartments typically have:</p><ol><li><p>Doors and windows: Make sure all your doors and windows are locked from the inside or outside. This will help you stay safe while you&rsquo;re home and prevent anyone from entering without permission.</p></li><li><p>Security cameras: If you have any security cameras in your apartment, make sure they&rsquo;re working properly and displaying live video footage of the area. This will help you spot anything that&rsquo;s not right and can help you report any suspicious activity to the police or management soon after it happens.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=kahana-manor---lahaina-hi--apartment-finder>Kahana Manor - Lahaina, HI | Apartment Finder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kahana-manor---lahaina-hi--apartment-finder>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://image4.apartmentfinder.com/i2/CZYFx0ECDg581Nca1NCyxThAPpJs6lCo7jKBsvySeXQ/117/kahana-manor-lahaina-hi-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Ou98oq2iVcj0f20C4zmZGgHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Kahana Manor - Lahaina, HI | Apartment Finder"><p><em>Source: apartmentfinder.com</em></p><blockquote><p>kahana manor lahaina hi apartments building hawaii.</p></blockquote><p>Rent vs. buying an apartment:
