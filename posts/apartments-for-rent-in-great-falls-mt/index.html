An apartment is a large, detached, single-family house or unit. It can be found in different styles and sizes depending on where it is situated. The earliest apartments were small huts used for housing the family of four. In the late 1800s, apartment buildings began to rise in popularity and were built in Prussian cities such as Berlin and Dresden. By the1920s, New York City and London had started to build large, high-rise apartments that became known as &ldquo;skyscrapers.&rdquo;
Today, apartment buildings are still an important part of the cityscape and are popular among tourists and professionals. They can provide a spacious living space with all the amenities one would need such as a kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and balcony. Apartments also offer an excellent opportunity to mix with other people on a daily basis.</p><h2 id=great-falls-mt-houses-for-rent---4-houses--rentcom>Great Falls, MT Houses For Rent - 4 Houses | Rent.com®<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#great-falls-mt-houses-for-rent---4-houses--rentcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,w_400,h_240,c_fill,q_auto:low,dpr_1.0,e_improve/e_unsharp_mask:50/e4dd9dc5482924cc9fe03dd4b9c6bf45 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Yth9Os71KumY7OYU6dodVgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Great Falls, MT Houses for Rent - 4 Houses | Rent.com®"><p><em>Source: rent.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are one of the most common types of housing in the United States.
