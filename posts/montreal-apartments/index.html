bedroom size and layout can affect the number of bedrooms.
Small apartments can have one or two bedrooms, while larger properties may have three or four bedrooms. The size of a bedroom affects both the number of bedrooms and the amount of living space that is available. The layout of a bedroom also affects the amount of space that is available for storage.
