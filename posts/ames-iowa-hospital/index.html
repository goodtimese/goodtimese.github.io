Apartments are one of the most common places to live in the United States. With an average of 2,000 apartments per capita, they offer a great place to live and raise a family. However, apartment complexes can be a risky place to live. There are a variety of factors that can make apartment complexes less safe for residents, and some have even gone so far as to call them “shady” or “unsafe.”
One of the most important things that residents should do when living in an apartment complex is to be aware of their surroundings.
