Most come with a kitchenette and one or two bathrooms.</li><li>Condos- These are large, five or six-bedroom apartments that sit on a large lot. They often come with gardens, private balconies, and robust security systems.</li><li>Townhouses- These are similar to condos but they are smaller and more condensed - often having only two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms.

The average rent for an apartment in the U.S. is $2,500, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. This is a high price point for apartments, especially when compared to other types of housing. The increase in rent prices has been caused by a number of factors, including population growth and the difficulty in finding affordable space. Additionally, landlords may be reluctant to renew leases because of fire or health hazards that could impact their businesses.</p><h2 id=the-village-at-joseph039s-run-apartments---midland-mi--apartmentscom>The Village At Joseph's Run Apartments - Midland, MI | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-village-at-joseph039s-run-apartments---midland-mi--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/wjRZad6jburIvLgYxenrDqwh7zfZ_mI2ZLHtwqTlTv8/117/the-village-at-josephs-run-midland-mi-village-at-josephs-run.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.qEv82rD5xI9KV9nkgNO-oQHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="The Village at Joseph's Run Apartments - Midland, MI | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>midland josephs forrent.</p></blockquote><p>Maintenance and repairs:
