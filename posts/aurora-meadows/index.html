Units that are close to transportation or other amenities are often more affordable than ones located further away from all these things. Another important factor to consider is what type of apartment the tenant will be using. Studios and one-bedrooms tend to be smaller than two- or three-bedroom units, so it may be a better decision not to have those in your search if you plan on living alone.</p><h2 id=view-photos--aurora-meadows>View Photos | Aurora Meadows<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#view-photos--aurora-meadows>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://commoncdn.entrata.com/images/thumbNailer.php?src=/media_library/4512/57f7f03c7cea3289.jpg&w=4096&h=2730" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._13lCCsk5Gv1wMO305ACtAHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="View Photos | Aurora Meadows"><p><em>Source: aurorameadows.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments can be more expensive

apartment complexes are often found in large metropolitan areas, and offer a variety of different amenities and layouts.
One type of apartment complex is the combinable apartments, which allow for people to live in multiple units with shared amenities. Another type of apartment complex is the co-housing model, which allows for people to live together in small makeshift buildings.</p><p>Apartments can be found in a variety of sizes, shapes and configurations.
