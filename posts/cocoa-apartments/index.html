Additionally, as homeless populations continue to grow, so too do the rates of apartment homelessness.
The problem with apartment homelessness is that it can be difficult for people who are homeless to find a place to live. Often, landlords do not consider people who are homeless when making decisions about how to manage their property. This leaves homeless people without any options other than sleeping on the streets or in shelters.</p><p>In addition to being difficult for those who are Homeless to find places to sleep, apartments also provide little opportunity for those who are experiencing poverty or low income.
