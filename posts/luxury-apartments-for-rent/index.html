There are a variety of apartments available in the city. They can be classified based on their function, size, and exterior design. Here are four examples:</p><ol><li>Houses- These are typically small, two- or three-bedroom apartments that sit on a small plot of land. Most come with a kitchenette and one or two bathrooms.</li><li>Condos- These are large, five or six-bedroom apartments that sit on a large lot. They often come with gardens, private balconies, and robust security systems.</li><li>Townhouses- These are similar to condos but they are smaller and more condensed - often having only two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms. They&rsquo;re perfect for people who want to live close to the center of town but don&rsquo;t need all the amenities that condos offer.</li></ol><h2 id=apartment-for-sale-1>Apartment For Sale<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartment-for-sale-1>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images.janglo.net/uploads/cs5f95376e131bf7.71760183Q5pK2jw9pxVWXyUUDgoNAvuDNjgdwNaTexd1iy.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.HHiJoUSRi8OPWdpBH2zn9wHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="Apartment for Sale"><p><em>Source: janglo.net</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Pets: are apartment dwellings allowed with pets?
Are Pets Allowed In Apartments?
There is no definitive answer to this question since it depends on the apartment complex and the rules of that particular complex. Generally speaking, pets are not allowed in apartments, but there is a wide range of exceptions depending on the apartment complex. Some complexes may allow pets while others may not. It is always best to check with the management of an apartment complex before making a decision about whether or not your pet can live in your unit.</p><h2 id=apartments>Apartments<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartments>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.brentwoodguesthouse.com/images/uploads/53/6058433940c82_Picture12.png?0.2415261400447064 onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.D4VGZqc3M0LOvVOf5LAuDQHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt=Apartments><p><em>Source: brentwoodguesthouse.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Tips for Planning your Apartment Move
