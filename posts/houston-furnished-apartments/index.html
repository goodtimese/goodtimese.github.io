Apartments can be a great place to live, but they come with a few important security and maintenance tips. Here are three tips to keep your apartment safe and humming:</p><ol><li><p>Make sure all systems are up and running - make sure the building&rsquo;s utilities are hooked up, the locks are set, and any windows or doors are locked.</p></li><li><p>Keep your property clean - often times apartments have limited resources so it&rsquo;s important to keep them clean as well. Sweep the floors, dust furniture, vacuum the floorboards - anything that can help reduce potential risks.</p></li><li><p>Be aware of your surroundings - if you see something suspicious or hear something mysterious, reach out to security or call police!</p></li></ol><h2 id=verdant-apartments---boulder-co>Verdant Apartments - Boulder, CO<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#verdant-apartments---boulder-co>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://www.nationalcorporatehousing.com/sites/default/files/styles/768x500/public/properties/swimming-pool_0.jpg?itok=XkSI6lAa" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GRK0A4SYcrYHKYgtNBsZCgHaE0&pid=15.1"' alt="Verdant Apartments - Boulder, CO"><p><em>Source: nationalcorporatehousing.com</em></p><blockquote><p>verdant.</p></blockquote><p>Location of apartments: Nearby schools, shopping, restaurants etc.

A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=1606--houston-corporate-housing>1606 | Houston Corporate Housing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1606--houston-corporate-housing>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.houston-corporate-housing.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1911HolcombeBlvd160677030-20217-MLS-_0005.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.wcfjj8fgvvacuB5EWBHNvQHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="1606 | Houston Corporate Housing"><p><em>Source: houston-corporate-housing.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Heat, cooling, noise and smoke exposure:
