Another is to install security cameras in your building, so you can see who&rsquo;s coming or going and make sure they&rsquo;re not causing damage.</p><p>Finally, be careful about who you let into your building. Make sure you have a list of people who have been approved by the police or other security forces before letting them into the building.
