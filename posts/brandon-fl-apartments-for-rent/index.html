As apartment landlords, you know that being secure and privacy-conscious is important in any building. But what about when someone is inside your building?
There are a few things that you can do to make sure your guests are safe and comfortable while they&rsquo;re in your building. One is to make sure all doors and windows are locked when they&rsquo;re not allowed in. Another is to install security cameras in your building, so you can see who&rsquo;s coming or going and make sure they&rsquo;re not causing damage.</p><p>Finally, be careful about who you let into your building. Make sure you have a list of people who have been approved by the police or other security forces before letting them into the building.
