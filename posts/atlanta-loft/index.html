However, over time, apartments slowly began to become more complex and luxurious. They could be built in different shapes and sizes, and often featured special features such as kitchens and bathrooms.</p><p>Today, apartments are a popular choice for people looking for a luxurious home away from home.

Heat-returning air conditioning systems (HRSAs) are commonly used in apartments to keep the living areas and corridors cool during the summer months.
