Meanwhile, the percentage of people living in apartments with roommates has decreased each year since 2012.</p><p>The reason for this change could be a variety of reasons; some say that people are choosing apartment living because it&rsquo;s more affordable than living with a family member or friend, while others may simply prefer having complete control over all aspects of their life inside an all-encompassing building.</p><h2 id=cheap-apartments-in-boise-city-id-from-772-with-photos--rentcafé>Cheap Apartments In Boise City, ID: From $772 (with Photos) | RENTCafé<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cheap-apartments-in-boise-city-id-from-772-with-photos--rentcafé>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://cdngeneral.rentcafe.com/dmslivecafe/3/555989/ID_Boise_WylieStreetStation_p0565574_1_01_1_PhotoGallery.jpg?crop=(0" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.s-LAGPsrA6rDfjK49pfpigHaEx&pid=15.1"' alt="Cheap Apartments in Boise City, ID: from $772 (with photos) | RENTCafé"><p><em>Source: rentcafe.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a great way to live in a city.
