A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=1295-madison-avenue-nyc---condo-apartments--cityrealty>1295 Madison Avenue, NYC - Condo Apartments | CityRealty<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1295-madison-avenue-nyc---condo-apartments--cityrealty>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://ds4.cityrealty.com/img/808c8abca2c8760f6aed853255064f751aca7007+w+h+0+60/1295-madison-avenue-00.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.JizxRTLSToCWxiqdxw8EpQHaEo&pid=15.1"' alt="1295 Madison Avenue, NYC - Condo Apartments | CityRealty"><p><em>Source: cityrealty.com</em></p><blockquote><p>1295 cityrealty carnegie approves eturbonews.</p></blockquote><p>Comparative prices of apartments in other cities.
