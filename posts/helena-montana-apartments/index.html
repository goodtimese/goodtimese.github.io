The five-story apartment buildings are becoming more and more popular. They offer many advantages over other types of apartments: they are easier to find, they&rsquo;re cheaper to buy, and they&rsquo;re usually much nicer than the two-story buildings.</p><p>There&rsquo;s one major drawback to five-story buildings: they can be too expensive.
