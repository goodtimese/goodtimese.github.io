A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=50014-zip-code-ames-iowa-profile---homes-apartments-schools>50014 Zip Code (Ames, Iowa) Profile - Homes, Apartments, Schools<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#50014-zip-code-ames-iowa-profile---homes-apartments-schools>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://pics4.city-data.com/mapszip/zma16070.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.puuVS10vtwAwgydPyo0YFAAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="50014 Zip Code (Ames, Iowa) Profile - homes, apartments, schools"><p><em>Source: city-data.com</em></p><blockquote><p>ames map zip ia code iowa profile population housing.</p></blockquote><p>Different types of apartments for different purposes:

If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to call your own, an apartment may be the answer. In fact, according to a report from apartment research site RENTCafé, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in America is $2,451 per month – which works out to be just over $30 per day. And while it may seem like an expensive proposition, there are plenty of ways to save on rent without moving out of your comfort zone.
For one, consider sleeping in your own bed instead of sharing a bedroom with someone else. Not only does this make living alone more affordable, but it also allows you to get more done in a shorter amount of time – meaning you can spend more time with loved ones.</p><h2 id=ames-iowa-neighborhood-map>Ames Iowa Neighborhood Map<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ames-iowa-neighborhood-map>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://ai2-s2-public.s3.amazonaws.com/figures/2017-08-08/33302eea3a38a78d65a8eaa4d13b9d2ac6b22506/53-Figure8-1.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tqwcC-lmScMjuFvZvu1WGQHaFx&pid=15.1"' alt="Ames Iowa Neighborhood Map"><p><em>Source: popmap.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>map ames iowa evaluating accessibility figure.</p></blockquote><p>What are the benefits of apartment living?

If you&rsquo;re looking for an apartment, it&rsquo;s important to consider the following things: size, price, location, and amenities. size is important because it affects how much space you&rsquo;ll have to spend on your own.
