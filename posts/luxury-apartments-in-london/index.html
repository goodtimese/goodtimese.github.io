However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=3-bedroom-apartment-for-sale-in-london>3 Bedroom Apartment For Sale In London<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-bedroom-apartment-for-sale-in-london>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://static.propertylogic.net/properties/2/525/943/1911257/IMG_wUb5SaUklV0ANbFJHAkHTWNVoKvlXSULuB398fjxS8CPB2QWGqcvKdaRgzN4_large.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._RX1IGBZUD4zkw0Aro_V5QAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="3 bedroom Apartment for sale in London"><p><em>Source: sovereign-house.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What are the benefits of apartments?
