A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year.

However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years.

A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://goodtimese.github.io/posts/apartments-alliance-oh/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Apartments Alliance Oh ~ About Hds</span></a>
