Renting an apartment generally means that you will be living in it for an entire period of time- usually between one and six months. Leases on the other hand, can be for a shorter or longer period- typically one to three years.
Most apartments these days come with some type of agreement in place in order to ensure that you will be living in them for at least the minimum length of time required by the lease.</p><h2 id=165-apartments-amp-homes-estero-florida-for-rent---byownercom>165 Apartments & Homes Estero, Florida For Rent - ByOwner.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#165-apartments-amp-homes-estero-florida-for-rent---byownercom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://www.byowner.com/thumb?src=https:%2F%2Fbo-photographs.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fswf_bear%2Fresidential-rental%2F43831078-62-0.jpg&h=298&w=400" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.0x9vJRjepgVMLykSZhCwQgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="165 Apartments & Homes Estero, Florida For Rent - ByOwner.com"><p><em>Source: byowner.com</em></p><blockquote><p>estero byowner.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing that is typically found in large cities.

When is an apartment good?
There are a lot of factors to consider when choosing an apartment, but location is usually one of the most important. Location can be determined by a variety of factors such as the price of rent, the size and shape of the apartments, and the distance from public transportation.</p><p>Some people believe that apartments in desirable locations are worth more than apartments in less desirable locations. This is because a better location often means more opportunities for activities and cultural experiences that can make up for a lower rent price.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an apartment with unique features or someone who will be living there long-term, it&rsquo;s important to look at the location before settling on any options.</p><h2 id=westchase-apartments-for-rent-in-fort-myers-fl--forrentcom>Westchase Apartments For Rent In Fort Myers, FL | ForRent.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#westchase-apartments-for-rent-in-fort-myers-fl--forrentcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.forrent.com/i2/YBIimVnDWpCTTCFrGVvVZMbggVNpB0jrU6SG4NCoKD4/117/image.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.G6ZEn4RaKhOs6B7VJ21pkQHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="Westchase Apartments For Rent in Fort Myers, FL | ForRent.com"><p><em>Source: forrent.com</em></p><blockquote><p>westchase.</p></blockquote><p>The Appeal of Apartments
