Apartments that are located in busy areas can be more expensive than those that are located in more rural areas, according to a study by real estate firm RENTCafé.
The study found that the average apartment price in the city of London was £2,898 per month, while the average price for an apartment in the rural area of Berkshire was £1,611 per month.</p><p>The study also found that apartments in the city of Washington D.C. were typically around $2,100 per month while apartments in the rural area of West Virginia were typically around $1,600 per month.</p><p>This suggests that if someone is looking to purchase an apartment they should look for a city with a high population density and low prices for housing.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://goodtimese.github.io/posts/pa-apartments/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>PA Apartments - Statues Of Women</span></a>
