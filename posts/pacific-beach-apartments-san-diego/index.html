Some people prefer to live in an apartment because they can walk to their jobs or nearby stores, while others might prefer living in a complex with multiple units so they can easily get around. It all comes down to what someone is looking for.
If you&rsquo;re looking for an apartment that&rsquo;s close to your job but don&rsquo;t mind having some extra noise and traffic, then a complex might be the best option for you. If you&rsquo;re prefer an apartment that offers everything from luxurious amenities like a fitness room and pool to basic necessities like parking and heat, however, a walk-up may be your best bet. Either way, take some time to explore all of the units before finding one that&rsquo;s just right for you.</p><h2 id=serenity-village-apartments---escondido-ca--apartmentscom>Serenity Village Apartments - Escondido, CA | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#serenity-village-apartments---escondido-ca--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/cSxF57DSSZGga1vZv2Vvt91ohsJP93zjXwQ4Nf4tfLI/111/serenity-village-escondido-ca-primary-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.4JSyMQHRX2WXKuw7Lktk3AHaEx&pid=15.1"' alt="Serenity Village Apartments - Escondido, CA | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>escondido.</p></blockquote><p>What are apartments and why do they exist?
