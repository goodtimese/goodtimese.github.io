Heat-returning air conditioning systems (HRSAs) are commonly used in apartments to keep the living areas and corridors cool during the summer months. They can be very effective at cooling down large areas, but they can also be a nuisance if left on for too long. To avoid waking up your roommate in the middle of the night, it is important to set up your HRSA wisely.</p><h2 id=103-hillview-rd-aurora-village-aurora--andrea-hanak>103 Hillview Rd, Aurora Village, Aurora | Andrea Hanak<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#103-hillview-rd-aurora-village-aurora--andrea-hanak>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.andreahanak.com/wp-content/uploads/mls/N4549548.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.FdbgCD5f4IvrHnYg6MNLWQHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="103 Hillview Rd, Aurora Village, Aurora | Andrea Hanak"><p><em>Source: andreahanak.com</em></p><blockquote><p>aurora.</p></blockquote><p>Types of apartments for different purposes:
