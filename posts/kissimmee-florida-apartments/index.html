Social housing is a type of housing that is provided to people who are living in poverty. It can be found in many places around the world, but it is most common in North America. Different types of social housing exist, such as tenure-based social housing and publicly funded social housing. tenure-based socialhousing is usually more affordable than public funded socialhousing, but it has a longer waitlist for applications.
Apartments are one type of social housing. They can provide a place to live with stability and privacy, as well as basics like food and water.
