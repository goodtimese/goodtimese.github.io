The history of apartments can be traced back to the beginnings of civilization. Places such as Egypt and Mesopotamia were home to large, city-like complexes that housed thousands of people. These complexes were known as mahalla, and they were often used as residences for the rich and powerful. In China, too, apartment buildings began appearing in the early centuries BCE. These buildings were known as “uan” or “lan”, and they consisted of a series of interconnected rooms.
As apartment buildings became more common in the modern world, they began to receive a number of different modifications. Some of these changes included the addition of balconies and other overlooks for residents to enjoy views from their homes. Additionally, apartment buildings became more spacious in order to accommodate more people.</p><h2 id=3-bedroom-san-antonio-vacation-rental-1-mile-from-the-riverwalk-amp-downtown-2>3 Bedroom San Antonio Vacation Rental 1 Mile From The Riverwalk & Downtown<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-bedroom-san-antonio-vacation-rental-1-mile-from-the-riverwalk-amp-downtown-2>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.savacationrentalhomes.com/swserve/site_assets/site10174/properties/38534/images/themed/221-12519leighst012.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.p5WzS0QK2q1Ru6qYQnw5CAHaE7&pid=15.1"' alt="3 Bedroom San Antonio Vacation Rental 1 Mile From The Riverwalk & Downtown"><p><em>Source: savacationrentalhomes.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are a type of housing that is typically found in large cities.
