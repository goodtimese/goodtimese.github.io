Apartments have a long and proud history, dating back to the ancient Greeks and Romans. They were not only used as living quarters for elites, but also became a key part of society as a way to better manage and protect their citizens.
Since the early days of apartment buildings, they have been designed to be luxurious and inviting, making them ideal for those who desire privacy and comfort. A few notable examples from throughout history include the Star-Kist Building in New York City, which was built in 1907 as a luxury hotel.
