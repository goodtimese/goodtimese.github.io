Another issue is that taller buildings can be less inviting than smaller ones, leading some people to feel like they&rsquo;re not getting a good deal.</p><h2 id=apartments-available---house-for-rent-in-st-louis-mo--apartmentscom>APARTMENTS AVAILABLE - House For Rent In St. Louis, MO | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#apartments-available---house-for-rent-in-st-louis-mo--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/-JARTt6ZUbzAv4inz-Zhr8K2rfbDOKGkF3ZtrPfIHlY/117/apartments-available-st-louis-mo-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ieijmkfSEupRQ25SRqkNBgHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="APARTMENTS AVAILABLE - House for Rent in St. Louis, MO | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>What is an apartment and why do people live in them?
