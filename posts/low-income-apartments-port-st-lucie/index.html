Rental rates are always changing, but the most popular types of apartments continue to be units that rent for a set amount of time, regardless of how often they may be rented. The terms &ldquo;rent&rdquo; and &ldquo;lease&rdquo; are often used interchangeably when talking about rental rates, but there are important distinctions to make. Renting an apartment generally means that you will be living in it for an entire period of time- usually between one and six months. Leases on the other hand, can be for a shorter or longer period- typically one to three years.
Most apartments these days come with some type of agreement in place in order to ensure that you will be living in them for at least the minimum length of time required by the lease.</p><h2 id=income-restricted-apartments-port-st-lucie---oncomie>Income Restricted Apartments Port St Lucie - ONCOMIE<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#income-restricted-apartments-port-st-lucie---oncomie>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1b/aa/d5/1baad5976c40486be089036943b21a0c.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.xyf6Tyxv49iMTt5tcojc6QHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Income Restricted Apartments Port St Lucie - ONCOMIE"><p><em>Source: oncomie.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>restricted pga.</p></blockquote><p>Location: What are the benefits of living in an apartment?
