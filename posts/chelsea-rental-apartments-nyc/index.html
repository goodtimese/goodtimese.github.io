A clean apartment is key to a comfortable and healthy lifestyle. However, many people do not take the time to keep their apartments clean. This can lead to a number of problems, such as decreased security and hygiene, increased hazard potential, and an overall less pleasant living environment. Maintenance is key in keeping an apartment clean. Here are three tips to help:</p><ol><li><p>Regularly Sweep the Walls and Floors: Sweep the walls and floors every week or two to remove any built-up dirt and bacteria. This will help reduce the risk of disease transmission and make your apartment more appealing for guests.</p></li><li><p>Use proper Furniture Care: Keep all furniture properly cared for by never leaving it unused for more than 4 hours at a time without cleaning it first. TheMariaDB Forums has a great guide on how to care for a couch or chair.</p></li><li></li></ol><h2 id=nyc-apartments--luxury-rentals-manhattan>NYC Apartments | Luxury Rentals Manhattan<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#nyc-apartments--luxury-rentals-manhattan>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://luxuryrentalsmanhattan.com/sites/default/files/uploads/renthigh.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.7_R3KohCcoLiDaB7u_m0AAHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="NYC Apartments | Luxury Rentals Manhattan"><p><em>Source: luxuryrentalsmanhattan.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments apartment nyc york poor rent east building village insurance manhattan reasons outside where rights finding should why fee door.</p></blockquote><p>Apartments are one of the most common types of housing in the United States.
