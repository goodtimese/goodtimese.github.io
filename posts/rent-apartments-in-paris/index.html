Here are four key distinctions between apartments and other types of housing:</p><ol><li><p>Rentals: In most cases, apartments are rented to individuals rather than being bought outright. This means that the landlord usually pays the tenant directly – either monthly or annually – rather than providing finance or assistance in finding a lender. As a result, rentals tend to be cheaper per month than buying an apartment outright.</p></li><li><p>Size: Apartments vary in size from small to large. Most typically comprise two or three bedrooms and one or two bathrooms, while some can contain up to six bedrooms and bathrooms.</p></li></ol><h2 id=-paris-apartments-paris-apartment-rentals-home>| Paris Apartments, Paris Apartment Rentals, Home<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#-paris-apartments-paris-apartment-rentals-home>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/8f/22/20/8f2220a9f760b7ed79e1fce78974b2d4--parisian-apartment-paris-apartments.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.p9zL6nIt6TxivHXETPW7UwHaEe&pid=15.1"' alt="| Paris apartments, Paris apartment rentals, Home"><p><em>Source: pinterest.co.uk</em></p><blockquote><p>parisperfect.</p></blockquote><p>Types of Apartments
