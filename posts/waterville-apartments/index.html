Here are four keytypes of apartment landlords:</p><ol><li><p>Tenant-in-possession (TIP): These landlords take on the responsibility of managing the property on behalf of their tenants. This can include checking in on residents, cleaning up after meals, and maintaining utilities. The biggest benefit to TIP landlords is that they typically have a much longer lease term than other types of landlord, making sure that tenants stay with them for as long as possible.</p></li><li><p>roommates only: These landlords allow tenants to live together but do notrent out the entire unit.instead, each tenant rents out a specific portion of their room or suite.</p></li></ol><h2 id=2-br-apartments-in-waterville-in-waterville--2-bedroom-apartment-6665>2 BR Apartments In Waterville In Waterville -2 Bedroom Apartment. 6665<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-br-apartments-in-waterville-in-waterville--2-bedroom-apartment-6665>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.radrenter.com/pictures/u006665-p0067768-big.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.4Tjl66fryaNNxGJYhJ4DbgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="2 BR Apartments in Waterville in Waterville -2 bedroom Apartment. 6665"><p><em>Source: radrenter.com</em></p><blockquote><p>radrenter waterville br apartments larger.</p></blockquote><p>Closing comments:

Apartments can be a great place to live, but they come with a few important security and maintenance tips. Here are three tips to keep your apartment safe and humming:</p><ol><li><p>Make sure all systems are up and running - make sure the building&rsquo;s utilities are hooked up, the locks are set, and any windows or doors are locked.</p></li><li><p>Keep your property clean - often times apartments have limited resources so it&rsquo;s important to keep them clean as well. Sweep the floors, dust furniture, vacuum the floorboards - anything that can help reduce potential risks.</p></li><li><p>Be aware of your surroundings - if you see something suspicious or hear something mysterious, reach out to security or call police!</p></li></ol><h2 id=waterville-me-rentals---apartments-and-houses-for-rent--realtorcom>Waterville, ME Rentals - Apartments And Houses For Rent | Realtor.com®<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#waterville-me-rentals---apartments-and-houses-for-rent--realtorcom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://ar.rdcpix.com/999217054/da04d55afb4f7da5b43edd57e2639eeec-f0od-w480_h480_q80.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.XqoWLKyE6gb9CLWnqvIwSQHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Waterville, ME Rentals - Apartments and Houses for Rent | realtor.com®"><p><em>Source: realtor.com</em></p><blockquote><p>hathaway waterville creative center apartments water st rent apartment maine rentals tours 3d doorsteps houses realtor.</p></blockquote><p>Different types of apartments have different costs.
