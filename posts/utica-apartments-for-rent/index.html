However, by knowing the attributes of an apartment, you can make the best decision for your needs. An apartment&rsquo;s size is important, as it affects how much room you&rsquo;re able to use. For example, a studio may have less space than a one-bedroom. In order to find an apartment that will fit your needs and budget, consider the size of the property and its surrounding area. An apartment location is also essential when looking for a place to call home.

A recent study by real estate firm RENTCafé found that, on average, apartment complexes need to be maintained twice a year. This means that landlords expect tenants to pay for these services at a rate of $50 per month. However, the study also found that many apartment complexes do not require such maintenance and only require cleaning and renovation once every 2 or 3 years. In order to avoid having to maintain an apartment complex more often than necessary, landlords should consider rat-catching and janitorial services as part of their regular maintenance plan.</p><h2 id=the-olbiston-apartments-apartments---utica-ny--apartmentscom>The Olbiston Apartments Apartments - Utica, NY | Apartments.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-olbiston-apartments-apartments---utica-ny--apartmentscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images1.apartments.com/i2/YReOCxUvv-9Lnd8hMCS7jWz5pDP2p-WcjDLdNYzovGE/117/the-olbiston-apartments-utica-ny-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.1ycuAfQXdMUSTCgUmZZYigHaD7&pid=15.1"' alt="The Olbiston Apartments Apartments - Utica, NY | Apartments.com"><p><em>Source: apartments.com</em></p><blockquote><p>apartments ny utica.</p></blockquote><p>What are the different types of apartment complexes?
