The size of apartments has become a major issue in the city. More people are living in larger, more expensive apartments than ever before. However, the shape of these apartments is also becoming a major issue.
The traditional &ldquo;boxy&rdquo; buildings are being replaced by more slender and elongated buildings. This change has had a significant impact on the concentration of population and businesses in certain areas of the city. Additionally, the use of glass and steel in apartment windows has made it difficult to see out from an apartment window, making it less inviting for residents.</p><p>Despite these challenges, there is still plenty of room for growth in the apartment market.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://goodtimese.github.io/posts/apartments-draper-utah/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Apartments Draper Utah : Diamond Ridge Townhomes Apartments</span></a>
