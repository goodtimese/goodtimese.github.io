In Rome, apartments were originally used as quarters for the rich and powerful, and in many cases remain an important part of today’s social lives. In modern times, apartment buildings have become a popular choice for individuals who want to live close to friends and family, but there are a few things that make them unique from other types of dwelling. The first thing that sets apartments apart from traditional homes is their size. A typical apartment typically occupies several hundred square feet - which is larger than most households in a town or city. This increase in space allows apartments to accommodate more people, making them more convenient and affordable than traditional homes.\nAnother unique characteristic of apartments is their location.\nPhotos Of EVO Apartments In Las Vegas, NV Source: evovegas.com\nupstairs.\nSize and layout: What are some common apartment features?
