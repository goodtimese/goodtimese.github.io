Here are six tips to help make the decision:</p><ol><li><p>Measure your needs: When measuring your needs, it&rsquo;s important to take into account what kind of living space you&rsquo;ll be using and how much space you&rsquo;ll have within your budget. A one-bedroom apartment might not be enough for someone who wants a lot of extra storage space, while a two-bedroom might fit more people comfortably.</p></li><li><p>Compare prices: It&rsquo;s also important to compare prices before signing a lease. Different areas have different rent rates and may require a higher or lower down payment than others.</p></li></ol><h2 id=via-apartments-for-rent---salt-lake-city-ut--rentalscom>Via Apartments For Rent - Salt Lake City, UT | Rentals.com<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#via-apartments-for-rent---salt-lake-city-ut--rentalscom>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://rentpath-res.cloudinary.com/t_rp,cs_tinysrgb,fl_force_strip,w_584,h_432,c_fill,b_rgb:131313,q_auto:best,dpr_1.0/e_unsharp_mask:50/e1f4fb184a08294076921505af07eaaf onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.yNNnkT9ZS0sFzOykB9-_2wHaFe&pid=15.1"' alt="Via Apartments For Rent - Salt Lake City, UT | Rentals.com"><p><em>Source: rentals.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>The Pros and Cons of Apartments:
