There are many types of landlords, depending on what type of apartment they are evicting.
Tenants who live in apartments should be aware of the following:
-A landlord is not limited to one type of apartment, and can evict a tenant for any reason.
-If an apartment is not fit for habitation, the landlord can sell it to another tenant or demolish it.
-Apartments are usually divided into two categories: &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; and &ldquo;floating.&rdquo; Fixed apartments are typically rented out month-to-month, while floating apartments allow for monthly rent but may also be available for lease or purchase.
Tenants who live in fixed apartments should be aware that they can&rsquo;t move out unless they get a new lease or break their current lease.</p><h2 id=1010-midtown---atlanta-ga--apartment-finder>1010 Midtown - Atlanta, GA | Apartment Finder<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1010-midtown---atlanta-ga--apartment-finder>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://image1.apartmentfinder.com/i2/zjDc4An-BSAR2gWoaHujtNvpWI9h1JbiN3YZz1edCGM/117/1010-midtown-atlanta-ga-building-photo.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.A4ySj69KpaSrvnGatvopWgHaLH&pid=15.1"' alt="1010 Midtown - Atlanta, GA | Apartment Finder"><p><em>Source: apartmentfinder.com</em></p><blockquote><p>midtown 1010 apartments atlanta ga primary georgia.</p></blockquote><p>What are apartments?
